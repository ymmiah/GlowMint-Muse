# ✨ GlowMint Muse

**GlowMint Muse** is an AI-Native Creative Platform where user vision meets the power of Google's Gemini and Imagen ecosystem. It is designed to be a co-pilot for creativity, handling everything from initial brainstorming to high-fidelity image generation and semantic editing.

Built exclusively with the **Google GenAI SDK**, it showcases the seamless integration of multimodal AI models.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Gemini Muse (Creative Chat)
The heart of the ideation process.
- **Conversational Brainstorming**: Chat with a specialized Gemini agent to refine abstract ideas into concrete visual descriptions.
- **Voice Input 🎙️**: Speak your ideas directly to the Muse.
- **Prompt Engineering**: The Muse automatically optimizes your natural language into technical image generation prompts.
- **Suggestion Chips**: Quick-start creative concepts to get the ball rolling.

### 🎨 Powerful Image Generation
Leveraging Google's latest models via Vertex AI / Gemini API.
- **Dual Model Support**:
  - `gemini-2.5-flash-image`: Fast, efficient generation for rapid iteration.
  - `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`: High-fidelity, photorealistic generation (supports up to 2K resolution).
- **Aspect Ratio Control**: Square (1:1), Portrait (3:4, 9:16), and Landscape (4:3, 16:9).
- **Negative Prompting**: Exclude unwanted elements from your compositions.

### 🪄 Multimodal Editing & Refinement
- **Magic Edit (Semantic Inpainting)**: Refine existing images using natural language instructions (e.g., "Change the background to a sunset", "Add a hat").
- **Gemini Critique Loop**: The **Gemini Vision** model analyzes generated images to provide stylistic tags and constructive critiques on composition or anatomy.

### 🗂️ Studio Workflow
- **History Navigation**: Undo (↩️) and Redo (↪️) functionality to traverse your creative session.
